                Technology and social values are strongly connected. 
                Before the time of technology, 
                humans have been building tools and cultures to improve our life’s and this 
                has not changed in 
                the world of data. It is a fact that technology have made daily tasks easier, 
                such as the washing machines, 
                as the invention made room and time in the individualistic life where one can 
                spend time on other things. 
                Our field of study will look at the digital practices implemented at school, 
                and how it has affected its society.

    The school system has been highly affected by the
    technological wave. This can be observed just by
    looking at the investment in computer devices like
    smartboard, ipads, computers etc. Research has
    shown that we learn better by doing, creating and
    watching than just listening and reading. School
    system now have to change the way of learning and
    the minds of the new generation. Innovation will be a
    benefitting skill as we tend to not stay for the same
    amount of time in our jobs as earlier. Our social values 
    are affected by this because we now expect more flexibility in learning
     methods and the availability of information at any time, any subject and anywhere in the world. Making it no longer 
     limited who can learn if the access to internet is available.
    
    
     <br>
    
    We concluded that we approve of this change as each student now can learn in new ways, 
    as it is giving us the opportunity to document and analyze how and what each 
    student’s strength and weakness is by using algorithms. 
    The downside of this is the unknow long lasting effects and the difference in each school ́s
     ability to follow this trend, giving some students an upper hand. As well as the concerns to 
     changing habits for old teachers <sub><a id="one" href="https://www.iberdrola.com/talent/learning-by-doing" target="_blank">[1]</a></sub>.

    The internet has a key role in creating different channels of communication that among other 
    things circulates news. 
    Especially through social media. With easy access to any information from any 
    corner of the world, the internet has reformed the world with its power to change not 
    only societal values, but also dynamics of conflict and political issues. 
    For example, in a report from Pew Research Centre, citizens from countries such as Jordan, 
    Tunisia and Lebanon indicated that access to internet and social media had made it easier to be 
    informed about current events in the political environment, making it easier to be involved. 
    Alternatively, the same report shows charts of negative affiliation to the internet as many believe 
    it is easier to be manipulated towards the government’s interests. Many Jordanians stated that a 
    visualisation of opinion through surveys and charts given by the government was one of the easiest 
    ways to sway the public towards the majority’s opinion <sub><a id="two" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/05/13/publics-think-technology-impacts-the-political-environment-in-both- positive-and-negative-ways/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sub> .
    
    
    
    
    An article from CSIS shows that countries such as China, Russia, 
    Iran and other authoritarian countries recognize the political risk that comes with 
    the internet but rather use the platform 
    for manipulating opinions and knowledge of their own populations. Russia is a known 
    benefactor of cognitive manipulation whereas they use cyber-attacks to spread information that 
    changes thoughts and behaviour by taking advantage of human pride, instincts and feel for nationalism
     <sub><a id="three" href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/short-discussion-internets-effect-politics" target="_blank">[3]</a></sub>.
    As a result of such authoritarian tendencies and exploitation of the public, 
    an annual review from Economics shows that there is an increasing wave of protests, 
    revolutions and movements, made to countermeasure notable control and manipulation inflicted on 
    the public <sub><a id="four" href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-economics-081919-050239" target="_blank">[4]</a></sub>.
    To conclude we can both see positive and negative political consequences, which all have impactful affects.
