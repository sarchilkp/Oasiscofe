<h1>Our review on how accessible our website is </h1>
<br>

<p>
    After being properly finished with designing and coding our webpage and 
    webtools we had to ensure whether or not our page was accessible. International 
    web standards express that even one with disabilities should be able to navigate easily
     through your website.  Accessibility is essential for both organizations and developers and 
     its requirement is there to benefit the individual-user, the business and the society. 

<br>
<br>

For our accessibility check, we used WebAccessibility: <a href="WebAccessibility.com">WebAccessibility.com</a> 

<div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;" class="picLeft">
  
    <img style="width: auto;"
    class="articleImg"
    src="img/webacces.png"
    alt="WebAcces front page"
    
    />
    
        
</div>
<br>
<br>

<h2>This is our review regarding following key points:</h2>
<br>

<p>Regarding perceiving and navigation through our page we found out that: 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    One thing to be sure of is that our website has room for being more accessible. 
    Although we have ensured that all images have a text alternative available, 
    we do not have any specific function that makes the webpage easier to navigate for one with either visual, 
    auditory, motor or cognitive disabilities. Meaning that there is no speech function to read different variables if 
    one needs it. Furthermore, we do have a zoom function, meaning the website can be easier to navigate for one with abilities 
    because of ageing. We do have to underline that because of the simplicity of our design,
    situational limitations such as bright sunlight is not taken into perspective when navigating our page, 
     <br>
     <br>

     Lastly, we did a check to see if our page was accessible for people with slow internet connection,
      and we did find that it was harder to navigate through the page even with its simple design, 
      as it would stop up.

      <br>
      <br>
    

    <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;" class="picRight">
  
        <img style="width: auto;"
        class="articleImg"
        src="img/dc.png"
        alt="image disabilities"
        
        />
        
    </div>

    <br>
    <br>

    Regarding whether our page is accessible for people without disabilities:  

    <br>

    This section is important as one should ensure that the page is accessible on different tablets of different sizes. 
    After running our page, we see that it is responsive even when the window minimizes, 
    although there is room for better designing of the different functions.
    <br>

    That aside, the website on its own is easy to navigate as it has a simple design. 
    
    You can go to any of the pages needed through the navigation bar. We also did the “tab-test” and all the main sections 
    are available to tab through, meaning that what we wish to have focus on is registered. As a whole we received 81% health 
    score after our test.  
    <br>


    <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;" class="picRight">
  
        <img style="width: auto;"
        class="articleImg"
        src="img/oasisCheck.png"
        alt="accessibility check oasis"
        
        />
        
    </div>

    <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;" class="picLeft">
  
        <img style="width: auto;"
        class="articleImg"
        src="img/nrkCheck.png"
        alt="accessibility check nrk"
        
        />
        
    </div>
    
     </p>
</p>
<br>
This is quite a good score if we were to compare it to pages such as NRK 
(although we keep in mind that they have a much more complex webdesign).
